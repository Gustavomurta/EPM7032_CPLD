# EPM7032S Parallel Programmer using Arduino Mega 

In 2024 I built this Parallel Programmer using the Arduino Mega. 
But I had some doubts about how the programming was done.
After confirming that it's necessary to enable parallel programming mode on the EPM7032S 
by applying 12V to pin 44 - EDIT/VPP, everything became clearer to me.
